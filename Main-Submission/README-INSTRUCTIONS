Hello Chris, please find the main python file, and main C++ file for running this project. 

	Unfortunately, this project is incomplete...im truly stumped.
	I tried my best to get this python server showing the correct information.
	It can successfully show the correct information/arrival time if you have 1 transfer, but if you have 2 or more transfers, then the information is incorrect. Thus this project is only suitable for a 4 station network
	
	
	the C++ program shows DIRECT ROUTES only. Thus only working on a 4 station network too.
	
	I hope I have shown enough evidence that i know a lot about networks with this code, even though its not a complete package............
	

	Although the file is C++, the main networking code is in C, and only some C++ data structures were used, such as Strings, and vectors.

	There is a folder called 'other files', but please dont assess the files in this folder. The scripts inside this folder were just for experimentation on my many attempts to get this project to work, and are just references for me
	However, if you need/require departure time information (instead of current time) then "station.py" inside other files, may be useful for you.

Running the python script (example):

	./station.py North_Terminus 4001 4002 4004
	
	

Running the C++ Script (example):

	g++ server.cpp -o station
	./station North_Terminus 4001 4002 4004
